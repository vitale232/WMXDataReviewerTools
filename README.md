# WMXDataReviewerTools
ArcGIS geoprocessing tools and scripts to execute Esri Data Reviewer from Workflow Manager on a Roads and Highways ALRS. These validation tools are implemented using an ArcGIS Python Toolbox in ArcGIS Desktop 10.5.1. Esri does a nice job documenting [Python Toolboxes](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.5/analyze/creating-tools/a-quick-tour-of-python-toolboxes.htm).

## Development Notes
+ With much of the code living in a Python package called validation_helpers, it's hard to get ArcGIS to consistently update the tool. Just open a blank map document with the Data Reviewer extension activated whenever you'd like to test code changes.
+ VSCode is failing to correctly lint the validation_helpers package. It incorrectly identifies properly imported code. To workaround the issue, if you use the Open Folder function, open the ./NYSDOT_Validations_Toolbox directory instead of the project root or use a different IDE.
