# WMXDataReviewerTools
ArcGIS geoprocessing tools and scripts to execute Esri Data Reviewer from Workflow Manager on a Roads and Highways ALRS. These validation tools are implemented using an ArcGIS Python Toolbox in ArcGIS Desktop 10.5.1. Esri does a nice job documenting [Python Toolboxes](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.5/analyze/creating-tools/a-quick-tour-of-python-toolboxes.htm).
